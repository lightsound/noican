# Clock drift and endurance

Part of the [macOS Build and Hardware Test Plan](../macos-hardware-test.md).

## Clock drift and endurance

The physical microphone and virtual output use different clocks; this is the
acceptance test for Aggregate Device drift compensation.

1. Use a physical USB microphone where possible, because its clock is
   clearly independent from BlackHole.
2. Run a continuous two-hour recording through Noican.
3. Speak or play a short reference tone every five minutes.
4. Inspect the entire file for discontinuities and measure reference-tone
   spacing.
5. Pass criteria:
   - no periodic click, duplicate block, or dropped block,
   - no increasing timing error,
   - no engine fault,
   - bounded memory use,
   - Aggregate Device remains alive.
6. Repeat sleep/wake, microphone disconnect/reconnect, and app quit/relaunch.
   Resource teardown must not leave a visible or reusable stale aggregate.

Record this result separately for each macOS major version under support,
especially macOS 26.
